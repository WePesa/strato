1. Slowly adding modules to section in stack.yaml that makes them compile pedantic

2. bug fixes- distance function in findnodes was broken.

3. Removing a bunch of duplicate code (UDP.hs in both ethereum-encryption and ethereum-discovery, postgres trigger code in both server, client).

4. Wrote code to make RLPx EIP8 compliant (needed in order to have communication work between Strato and geth).

5. Moved PPeer definition and ownership to ethereum-discovery.

6. Centralized point/byte conversion functions in ethereum-encryption.

7. Began the splitting of strato-setup into individual components managed separately.  So far, I've only separated out ethereum-discovery's setup.
